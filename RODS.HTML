<p>Classification:
    AWS A5.1 : E6013
    ISO 2560: E432 R11
    DIN 1913: E4322 R (C) 3
    
    Description:
    Pak Bridge (J-421) is a kind of carbon steel electrode with titania type coating. AC/DC. It has excellent welding performance; operates with quiet arc and smooth bead with fine ripples, gives medium penetration, least spatter, lower smoke and easily detachable slag. Easy arc strike and re-strike with superior mechanical properties.
    
    Application:
    Excellent general purpose electrode for welding low-carbon steel structures. Especially suitable for welding on the plates and cosmetic welding which requires the weld beads to be beautiful and glossy. Suitable for welding structures of steel, vehicles, truck frames and bodies, ships, storage tanks, boiler tubes, railway coaches, bridges, buildings steel furniture, window frames, grills, machinery-manufacture, vessels and various structures of low carbon steel.

        JIS Specification: D4313
        Description:
        Diamond brand is a rutile coated electrode with self lifting slag. Excellent strike and re-strike with virtually no tendency to stick. It can be used in any position with AC and DC. It provides excellent welding technological performance because the arc is extra stable and the spatter loss is negligible, gives medium penetration, lower smoke and easily detachable slag with superior mechanical properties. It has been designed for users who prefer one electrode for all position. 
        
        Application:
        Diamond Brand is an excellent fully position general purpose electrode for welding mild steel. It can be used for automobile bodies, truck frame and bodies, storage tanks, pressure vessels, ship building, ornamental iron, scooter frames, locomotive fireboxes, railway coach panels, fine steel furniture, metal furniture, farm implementations and machinery.

<p>Product details
    Item Dimensions LxWxH	37 x 7 x 3 Centimeters
    Brand	KING
    Compatible Material	Alloy Steel
    CAN USE WITH STEEL TANKS, GRILLS, PIPES, SHEETS, COLUMNS, FURNITURE E.
    The 6013 electrode is often used in situations that involve irregular or short welds that require a change in position because it provides a very stable arc and a smooth finish.
    6013 is an all- purpose electrode that provides a soft steady arc which is easily regenerated, easy slag control for vertical-down welding, low spatter and a beautiful bead appearance.
    A versatile, deep penetrating steel electrode with smooth, stable arc characteristics. The coating produces a forceful, spray-type arc, resulting in deep penetrating welds. The slag is thin and easily removable. <br>number=8,10,12</p>
